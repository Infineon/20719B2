# AIROC&#8482; BTSDK - CYW20719

## Overview

The Infineon CYW20719 is an ultra-low-power dual-mode Bluetooth&#174; 5.4 wireless MCU device. It has a stand-alone baseband processor with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting LE/BR/EDR.

## SDK Software Features
- Dual mode Bluetooth&#174; stack included in the ROM (BR/EDR and LE).
- Bluetooth&#174; stack and profile level APIs for embedded Bluetooth&#174; application development.
- AIROC&#8482; HCI protocol to simplify host/MCU application development.
- APIs and drivers to access on board peripherals.
- Bluetooth&#174; protocols include GAP, GATT, SMP, RFCOMM, SDP, AVDT/AVCT
- LE and BR/EDR profile APIs, libraries, and sample apps.
- Support for Over-The-Air (OTA) upgrade.
- Device Configurator for creating custom pin mapping.
- Bluetooth&#174; Configurator for creating LE GATT Database.
- Documentation for APIs, datasheet, profiles, and features.
