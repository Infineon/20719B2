/*
    Description of the values in function_numbers_t
    The names themselves explain the purpose.  The one case that needs a description is UNAVAILABLE
    It was intended that the g_GPIO_function_map would be initialized with UNAVAILABLE for two cases
    The first case is that the pin doesn't leave the package and therefore is UNAVAILABLE
    The second case is that the reference board does not expose that pin and therefore it is UNAVAILABLE
    That implies a matrix of g_GPIO_function_map arrays that are package and platform aware which may not be practical
    But the capability is built into the code anyway
