* Abstract: Allows the application to register a callback that will be invoked

*           immediately after.
*
* Input : clientCallback - Pointer to a function that will be invoked in application

                           before ADV and WICED_BT_ADV_NOTIFICATION_DONE after ADV
                           packet is complete.
*         advanceNoticeInMicroSeconds - Number of microseconds before the ADV the
*                          notification is to be sent. Will be rounded down to
*                          the nearest 1.25mS. Has to be an even multiple of 625uS.
* Output: TRUE if feature available, FALSE otherwise.
